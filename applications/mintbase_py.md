## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Tagline:** Simplifying NFT operations on the NEAR Protocol with Python.
- **Description:** mintbase-py is a powerful open-source library for performing various operations related to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the NEAR Protocol using Python. It provides convenient functionalities for deploying or interacting with smart contracts, managing wallet connections, accessing blockchain data, uploading metadata to permanent storage, and handling message signing and verification. This project aims to empower Python developers to build NFT-based applications on the NEAR Protocol with ease.
- **Relevance:** mintbase-py enhances the developer experience within the NEAR ecosystem by providing a Python-centric solution for NFT-related tasks. It aligns with Mintbase's mission of fostering developer-friendly tools and expanding the capabilities of the NEAR ecosystem.
- **Interest:** Our team is interested in creating mintbase-py to address the need for a Python library that simplifies NFT operations on the NEAR Protocol. We are passionate about open-source development and believe that mintbase-py will lower the barrier to entry for Python developers looking to leverage the NEAR blockchain for NFT projects.

### Project Details

- **UI Mockups/Designs:** N/A (Not applicable)
- **Data Models/API Specifications:** Will be provided in the project documentation.
- **Technology Stack:** Python, NEAR Protocol, JavaScript (for interfacing with existing @mintbase-js packages)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation covering installation, usage, and examples will be provided.
- **Prior Work:** N/A
- **Project Limitations:** mintbase-py will focus solely on providing Python bindings for existing @mintbase-js packages and will not implement blockchain-specific functionalities.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Integration:** mintbase-py seamlessly integrates with existing @mintbase-js packages, providing Python developers with access to NFT functionalities on the NEAR Protocol.
- **Target Audience:** Python developers, NEAR dApp developers, and anyone building NFT-based applications on the NEAR Protocol.
- **Need:** mintbase-py meets the need for a Python-centric library for NFT operations on the NEAR Protocol, enhancing accessibility and usability within the Python development community.
- **Similar Projects:** While there may be similar projects in related ecosystems, mintbase-py is tailored specifically for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem, providing unique value to Python developers within this context.
